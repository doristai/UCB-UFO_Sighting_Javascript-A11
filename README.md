# UCB-UFO_Sighting_Javascript-A11

## Overview
The aim of the project is to build an HTML page for importing the UFO sighing information from javascript data file and apply filter on the page to allow the data searching from our database. The filters are based on date, city, states and shape of the sighting. 

### Languages Used

- CSS

- Javascript

## Results

**Visualisation of the Website**![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70616488/120170596-f9da3280-c1b5-11eb-9124-4d9864360c26.png)


On the top of the website has the description and the purpose of the website, including titles, headings and an image as the backhround. Scrolling down the page, we can see different UFO sighting data on the right. On the left, there contains different filters allow people to quickly find their data of interests.

## Summary

We successfully created website for better visualisation and searching of the data by incorporating with different filters. 

**Drawback :** If the filter for the date can enter a range of time, it can be better for people to examine the incident of UFO sighting during a specific period of the year. 

**Recommendations :**

- Data can include information on the incident of UFO sighting at specific time of the day. So people can use that information to predict the most likely occur time of the day for the future at specific location. 

- The database needs to update constantly, so more data will be added. More accurate and useful information can be provided for the users, and the views of the website might increase due to the constant update.
